# Fraud-Detection
1. We use RandomForestClassfier to predict transaction.

1. Data Preprocessing
    * Merge two data frame.
    * Handle missing data field.
    
1. Model's performance
    * Accuracy
    * Recall Score
    * Precision Score
    * F1 Score
 
1. Imbalanced Dataset
    * Under-sampling

# Dataset

Because the train_transaction.csv is too large, we use smaller version of
it(simple_train_transaction.csv)
